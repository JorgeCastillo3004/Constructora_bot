Introduction
Welcome to the project! This guide will help you set up the necessary environment to run the application smoothly.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Git
Python
pip
Clone Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JorgeCastillo3004/Constructora_bot.git
This command clones the project repository to your local machine.

Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
cd aplicacion
python -m venv env_chat
env_chat\Scripts\activate
Navigate to the "aplicacion" directory, create a virtual environment named "env_chat," and activate it. This isolates project dependencies.
